            <p> We are KNESIS, the original and only K-POP cover dance team at New York University.
                We are comprised of members from all different backgrounds and levels of dance experience!
                We regularly post dance covers and we hope to spread our love for K-POP and K-POP culture through our videos!</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "aboutusentryright">
            <p> We have weekly classes every Friday from 4-6pm! Normal classes take place in Kimmel Center Room 606,
                but because of COVID restrictions this year, our classes are all virtual. Classes are open to everyone,
                regardless of experience or skill level! </p>

            <p> You can audition for our dance covers! Each of our covers has independent auditions, and each cover is led by
                one of our dance instructors. There are two types of covers, "inside" and "outside" covers - "inside" covers are covers of
                songs that have been taught in class, while "outside" covers need to be learned completely independently. Everyone is welcome
                to audition for any covers!
